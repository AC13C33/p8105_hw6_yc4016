# Problem 3

```{r}
birthweight = 
  read_csv("data/birthweight.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(babysex = as.factor(babysex),
          frace = as.factor(frace),
          malform = as.factor(malform), 
          mrace = as.factor(mrace)) %>% 
  drop_na()

birthweight
```
* No missing data

```{r}
model_fit = lm(bwt ~ babysex + bhead + bwt + delwt + gaweeks + malform + menarche + mheight + momage + mrace, data = birthweight)

model_fit %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)

summary(model_fit)
```
* The model is a linear regression model. It has include variable contains baby's information and basic mother's information (babysex, bhead, bwt, delwt, gaweeks, malform, menarche, mheight, momage, mrace)

```{r}
birthweight = 
  birthweight %>% 
  add_predictions(model_fit) %>% 
  add_residuals(model_fit)

birthweight
```
* I have added the predictions and residuals. 

```{r}
plot1 =
  birthweight %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = pred, y = resid)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, cex=0.5) +
  labs(title = "Residuals against fitted values",
       x = "Fitted values",
       y = "Residuals") 

plot1
```
* I have create a plot that is residuals against fitted values

```{r}
model1 = lm(bwt ~ blength + gaweeks, data = birthweight)

model1 %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)

summary(model1)



model2 = lm(bwt ~ bhead + blength + babysex + bhead * blength + bhead * babysex + blength * babysex + bhead * blength * babysex, data = birthweight)

model2 %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)

summary(model2)
```
* I have create two models.

```{r}
cv_df = 
  crossv_mc(birthweight, 100) %>% 
  mutate(train = map(train, as_tibble),
         test = map(test, as_tibble)) %>% 
  mutate(model1 = map(.x = train, ~lm(bwt ~ blength + gaweeks, data = birthweight)),
         model2 = map(.x = train, ~lm(bwt ~ bhead + blength + babysex + bhead*blength + blength*babysex + bhead*babysex + bhead*blength*babysex, data = birthweight)),
         model_fit = map(.x = train, ~lm(bwt ~ babysex + bhead + bwt + delwt + gaweeks + malform + menarche + mheight + momage + mrace, data = birthweight))) %>% 
  mutate(rmse_model1 = map2_dbl(.x = model1, .y = test, ~rmse(.x,.y)),
         rmse_model2 = map2_dbl(.x = model2, .y = test, ~rmse(.x,.y)),
         rmse_model_fit = map2_dbl(model_fit, .y = test, ~rmse(model = .x, .y))) 

cv_df 
```
* I have create model comparison between model1, model1 and model_fit using cross validation.

```{r}
plot2 =
  cv_df %>% 
  select(starts_with("rmse")) %>% 
  pivot_longer(everything(),
               names_to = "model", 
               values_to = "rmse",
               names_prefix = "rmse_") %>% 
  mutate(model = fct_inorder(model)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = model, y = rmse)) + 
  geom_violin()

plot2
```
* From plot2, model2 has lowest rmse, so model2 might be the best model.
