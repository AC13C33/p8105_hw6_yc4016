# Problem 3

  mutate(babysex = as.factor(babysex),

          mrace = as.factor(mrace)) %>% 
  drop_na()

birthweight
```
* No missing data

```{r}
model_fit = lm(bwt ~ babysex + bhead + bwt + delwt + gaweeks + malform + menarche + mheight + momage + mrace, data = birthweight)

model_fit %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)

summary(model_fit)
```
* The model is a linear regression model. It has include variable contains baby's information and basic mother's information (babysex, bhead, bwt, delwt, gaweeks, malform, menarche, mheight, momage, mrace)

```{r}
birthweight = 
  birthweight %>% 
  add_predictions(model_fit) %>% 
  add_residuals(model_fit)

birthweight
```
* I have added the predictions and residuals.
